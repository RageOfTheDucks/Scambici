# Scambici

Bike rental service for human beings.

This is the project my colleagues [@natras2](https://github.com/natras2), [@kmfrick](https://github.com/kmfrick) and I developed for our Software Engineering exam at the University of Bologna in 2020.

We developed a REST API in C# using the .NET Framework and an HTML/CSS/JS front-end using jQuery and Hugo as our template engine.

The API is deployed as a set of serverless Azure Functions, while the front-end is hosted on GitHub Pages. 

The front-end is available at https://natras2.github.io/ScambiciGUI .

We are releasing the source code under the GPLv3 license.
